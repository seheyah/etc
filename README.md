Some configuration files for OpenBSD 7.x


Relayd.conf(https://github.com/seheyah/etc/blob/main/relays.conf)
A very simple relayd.conf file where all request coming for external not requesting strictly your domain name lie example.xyz but the ip for example are forwarding to <sorry> where <sorry> equal httpforever(http://httpforever.com)

Have fun
