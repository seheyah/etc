# Some configuration files for OpenBSD 7.x
🎯 This repository hosts some basic file configuration on [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org)

🛡️ Secure your network home or a standalone server and reduce the noisy traffic.

## Prerequisites
 * You need to have an account with doas set correctly.

# /etc/relayd
📝 Here the [man](https://man.openbsd.org/relayd.conf) for relayd configuration file.

* My file here [relayd.conf](https://github.com/seheyah/etc/blob/main/relayd.conf)
A very simple relayd.conf file where all request coming for external not requesting strictly your domain name like example.xyz but the ip for example are forwarding to <sorry> where <sorry> equal httpforever(http://httpforever.com) in this example.

🐡 Have fun!
